# Gout Prediction Using NLP

## Project Overview
This project aims to enhance the early detection of gout disease by analyzing chief complaint data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The predictive models developed in this study leverage chief complaints from the GOUT-CC-2019-CORPUS and GOUT-CC-2020-CORPUS datasets to identify patterns indicative of gout.

## Dataset
The GED3C dataset, including the GOUT-CC-2019-CORPUS and GOUT-CC-2020-CORPUS, was used. This dataset consists of chief complaints recorded by triage nurses in an urban academic medical center, offering insights into potential gout flares.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Textual chief complaints underwent cleaning, tokenization, stop word removal, and other preprocessing steps to prepare them for analysis.
2. **Feature Engineering**: New features like Text Length, Special Char Count, Word Count, and others were derived to enhance the predictive capability.
3. **Model Development**: Various models, including Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forests, Neural Networks, and Gradient Boosting, were trained and evaluated on their ability to predict gout from the chief complaints.

## Results
Among the models evaluated, the Neural Network architecture (Model 12) post-feature engineering emerged as the most promising, demonstrating notable accuracy and enhanced recall scores, indicating heightened sensitivity in identifying gout-related complaints.

## Challenges and Future Work
- Addressing data imbalance and model complexity were significant challenges impacting the models' generalizability.
- Future research directions include focusing on interpretability, fairness, and robustness to augment early detection strategies for gout disease.

## Code Appendix
The code used for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation are uploaded. This includes scripts for data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive approach to predicting gout disease using NLP and ML, laying the groundwork for advancements in healthcare decision-making and disease prediction research.
